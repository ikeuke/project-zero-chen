### Project 0 : HARDWARE HARDBALL

A game that tests the knowledge the players knowledge of hardware ands its terms and labels. 


Basics: Player will start the game where they are presented an image of computer hardware. They will  

click the image and must type the name of the item to get credit. 


This game was built as the first project for a software engineering course taken at General Assembly.

This game was built by an an introductory level junior software developer 

with 9 nine days of coding knowledge. Javascript was built in 9 days . 

For medium to advance software engineers the game is not complext to build 

but this game is to represent how small beginnings can grow into momentus 

potential. The point is everyone starts somewhere. Never feel discouraged. 




### User Stories/game logic

from the viewpoint of its players. Every tool is essential , and understanding

the fundamentals, or at least identification, of 


hardware is just as  essential.
